# Raspberry Pi Cluster

This guide will detail how to deploy the images you built for the KX.AS.CODE Raspberry Pi cluster.

This is still a work in progress. You can follow our Raspberry Pi enablement progress on our [Discord Raspberry Pi channel](https://discord.gg/XC64HNgeXK){:target="\_blank"}!

!!! info
    If you have not yet built the images, see the [Raspberry Image Build Guide](../Build/Raspberry-Pi-Cluster.md).

!!! danger "Important"
    This has only been tested on an 8GB Raspberry Pi 4B. It is not recommended to use anything less, as the resources will not be sufficient to run all the KX.AS.CODE services! Also note that one Raspberry Pi 4B will not be enough. In our testing, we have used four Raspberry Pi 4B boards setup in a 1 x KX-Main and 3 x KX-Workers configuration.

## Hardware Pre-requisites

Here are the components we used in our test cluster.

Here some photos from our first setup, including some of our learnings.

!!! warning
    The Raspberry Pi does not have enough power to keep the NVME drive running. A powered hub is required. Either choose another type of drive, or like us, purchase a bunch of powered hubs, to manage it

Not on the list and not mandatory, but a nice touch is to add some luminous labels. :smile:
