# Raising a Bug Report

Before raising an issue, be sure to follow the [troubleshooting](../Deployment/Troubleshooting.md) steps.

!!! bug
    If that didn't help, then you can raise an issue on [Github.com](https://github.com/Accenture/kx.as.code/issues){:target="\_blank"}.

In some cases, it may be possible to confirm if it's a bug or not in the [KX.AS.CODE Discord channel](https://discord.gg/FXeavNQnC5){:target="\_blank"}, before raising the ticket.

!!! important
    Be aware that we will not be able to respond in real time, as this is currently more of a hobby project, and we still have our usual day job.

Be sure to include the following information in your ticket.

- KX.AS.CODE `version`
- Virtualization environment
- If relevant, name of application failing to install
- Problem description
- Log snippets from the `/usr/share/kx.as.code/workspace directory` (do `ls -altr` to see the last files/log entries)
- Log snippet from `/var/log/syslog` if relevant

As this is an open source solution, it does not officially come with any support, however, we will try to respond as best as we can to any open tickets.
