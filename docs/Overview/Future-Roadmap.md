# Roadmap

Just some ideas for now. Let us know your thoughts.

1. Expand the node portal we created. Still early days and lots to do. :construction: `In progress`
2. Add possibility to deploy applications with Kustomize
3. ARM support, for running on Macs and maybe even a Raspberry Pi! :construction: `In progress`
4. Add K3s when choosing KX.AS.CODE "Lite". :white_check_mark: released in `v0.8.9`
5. Add Private Cloud and Public Cloud builds to Jenkins setup
6. Add more central functions for Gitlab and other solutions :white_check_mark: released in `v0.8.9`
