# Raising a Feature Request

You may request additional features, and we will try to accommodate as many as we can. As this is more of a hobby project for us presently, next to our usual workloads, we may not be able to implement new features quickly, but we will do our best!

Please raise the issue on [Github.com](https://github.com/Accenture/kx.as.code/issues){:target="\_blank"}. Once raised, we will categorize the ticket and add additional labels.

You can also post ideas to our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/FXeavNQnC5){:target="\_blank"}.
